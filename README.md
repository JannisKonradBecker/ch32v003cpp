# ch32v003cpp
trying to create a nice abstraction for wch [ch32v003](http://www.wch-ic.com/products/CH32V003.html) maximizing compile time checking and readability without incurring runntime cost. Inspired by [ch32v003fun](https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun/tree/master) and based on [cppreg](https://github.com/nicocvn/cppreg) and [cmsis-svd](https://github.com/posborne/cmsis-svd)

works well with [minichlink](https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun/tree/master/minichlink)

TODO:
- use c++ startup from [five-embeddeb](https://github.com/five-embeddev/riscv-scratchpad/tree/master/baremetal-startup-cxx/src)
